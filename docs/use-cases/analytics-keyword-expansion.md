# Analytics - Keyword Expansion

Let's imagine we are sitting in the marketing department of a company selling jewelry. We need to plan a campaign with some corner points:
- it should be running on Facebook Ads
- it should be approximately a month long
- we should spend ballpark 500 USD on it daily
- the ad creative is not perfectly set, but should be centered around the term "embrace your individuality"

Now, we have to find keywords to target the ad with.

In order to do that, we have past campaign data at our disposal. In this use case the aim is to showcase how to drill through the data effectively to help our efforts finding the best keywords.
