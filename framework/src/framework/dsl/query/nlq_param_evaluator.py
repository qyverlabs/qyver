           - Clearly define each parameter's purpose and functionality.
           - Specify the expected data types and any relevant constraints.

        To achieve this you essentially need to extract weights and other values. The multimodal
        vectors are creating by vectorizing extracted query input values, concatenating them, and re-weighting them
        afterwards. Spaces are the abstractions holding the vectorized versions of inputs. Weights for .with_vector and
        .similar clauses essentially control their importance compared to each other, while space weights are applied on
        top of these, controlling the importance of each vector part, like text, numerical data, recency or categorical
        data - of which multiple can be present in each vector. So however high similar (or with_vector) clause weights
        are set if the corresponding space weight is low, they will have low effect.
        If the field is not related in any way to the user prompt, you can use the default value.
        If the user prompt is "I'm looking for a blue dog", search for a field that is related a color field and a field
        that is related to an animal, and set their values "blue" and "dog" respectively. Their weights should be equal
        and non-zero. If the user shows extra preference for an attribute, give them bigger weight. If a user expresses
        opposite preference, give that attribute negative weight. The name of the field, the corresponding "space" and
        "schema_field" can help identify what the field is used for. You will now get information about the spaces, and

        1. Try separating text referring to different text fields. "Comedy movies about gangsters" would mean a .similar
        clause corresponding the genre field would get the input "comedy" while the .similar clause of the description
        field would receive the input "gangsters". Their weight could be uniform 1.\n
        2. Think about recency in context with the space description. If they say old or recent movies, it is simple,
        the weight has to be negative or positive, respectively. Having a recency space spanning over 30 years, if
        the query asks for "drama movies from the 2010s", which are around 10-20 years old, the best you can do is set
        recency weight smaller compared to other weights (genre weight for drama), but positive.\n
        3. If adjectives are used, reflect them on the query. Absolute preference, excluding other options probably
        refers to a filter clause. If there are no filter clause, that space or clause should have higher weight, than
        the others. In the case of "Very recent action movies about the Cold War era" very recent would mean a higher
        recency weight than the genre space (with "action" input) and the description, or possibly setting space (with
        the input "Cold War era").\n
        4. When dealing with numbers, the Mode of the NumberSpace is of utmost importance. Also, sometimes number space
        references are a bit harder to extract. "High quality products" would mean positive weight for a rating, or
        the like space that conveys quality of the product - even though there is no direct reference to ratings or
        reviews. Conversely, if the space refers to how bad the product is, like number of complaints, high quality
        would mean a negative weight in that case.\n
        5. Categorical spaces can only have a limited set of values specified in the space description. If you see text
        present in the query that is present in the categorical similarity space description, it most probably refers to
        that space. Fill the corresponding .similar clause input with the value (multiple are possible) and give it
        positive weight - unless the query specifies preference against that category - in that case use a negative
        weight.\n
